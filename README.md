   ## Installation
   The installation steps are simple - do a npm i and then npm start. This would start the API server and would listen for requests. Now, we could use insomnia to test all our backend endpoints.

   ## Technologies
   Mongoose ODM, MongoDB database, Insomnia, TypeScript, Javascript, Controllers, npm

   ## Usage
   Please do a npm i and then npm start to start the API server. Now, we could use insomnia to test all our endpoints as documented in the walkthru video. The below screen shots helps you visualize the workflow / functionality

   ## Walkthru-Video
   Please watch the below link explaining how to start the application and test all the API endpoints.
   
   
   ## Challenges
   During the project, testing all the different endpoints was time taking as the data needs to be verified meticulously but it was interesting to understand the relationships between different objects within Mongo.  
   

   ## Tests
   Ensure the app opens and ensure you are able to test all the endpoints as demonstrated in the walkthru video.

   ## Future Implementation
   Integrate with the Front end application to complete the fully functional Social Network Application using MongoDB database.
